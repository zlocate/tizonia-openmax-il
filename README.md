## Introduction ##

The Tizonia project consists of a number of resources.

### `tizonia`: music player and audio streaming client/server ###

* Playback of audio formats from local media (supported file formats: mp3, mp2,
  mpa, m2a, aac, ogg/vorbis, opus, wav, aiff, and flac).
* Spotify client.
* ICEcast/SHOUTcast streaming server (supported formats: mp3).
* ICEcast/SHOUTcast streaming client (supported formats: mp3, aac, and opus, more to be added in the future).
* Deamon and command line modes (no GUI).
* MPRIS D-BUS v2 media player remote control interface (work-in-progress).
* Based on OpenMAX IL 1.2. No gstreamer, libav, or ffmpeg needed for audio
  decoding (although libav is currently used for probing of media files; this
  dependency will be removed soon ).
* Written in C++.

### An OpenMAX IL 1.2 based multimedia framework ###

1. 'libtizonia' : An OpenMAX IL 1.2 component framework
  * A C library for creating OpenMAX IL 1.2 plugins (encoders, decoders,
  parsers, sinks, etc, for audio/video/other).
  * Full support for OpenMAX IL 1.2 Base and Interop profiles.
2. 'libtizcore' : An OpenMAX IL 1.2 Core implementation
  * A C library for discovery and dynamic loading of OpenMAX IL 1.2 plugins.
  * Support for all of the OMX IL 1.2 standard Core APIs, including *OMX_SetupTunnel* and *OMX_TeardownTunnel*.
3. 'libtizplatform' : An OS abstraction/utility library
  * A C library with wrappers and utilities for:
    * memory allocation,
    * threading and synchronization primitives,
    * evented I/O (via libev)
    * FIFO and priority queues,
    * dynamic arrays,
    * associative arrays,
    * small object allocation,
    * config file parsing,
    * HTTP parser,
    * uuids,
    * etc..
4. An OpenMAX IL 1.2 Resource Management (RM) framework
  * 'tizrmd' : a D-Bus-based Resource Manager server.
  * 'libtizrmproxy' : a C client library to communicate with the RM daemon.
5. OpenMAX IL 1.2 plugins
  * mp3 decoders (libmad and libmpg123),
  * Spotify streaming service client (libspotify),
  * mpeg audio (mp2) decoder (libmpg123),
  * Sampled sound formats decoder (various pcm formats, like wav, etc, based on libsndfile)
  * AAC decoder (libfaad),
  * OPUS decoders (libopus and libopusfile)
  * FLAC decoder (libflac)
  * VORBIS decoder (libfishsound)
  * PCM renderers (ALSA and Pulseaudio)
  * OGG demuxer (liboggz)
  * HTTP renderer (i.e. ala icecast)
  * HTTP source (based on libcurl)
  * mp3 encoder (based on LAME),
  * a VP8 video decoder (libvpx),
  * a YUV video renderer (libsdl)
  * general purpose plugins, like binary file readers and writers
  * etc...
6. Skema: A Python test execution framework for OpenMAX IL 1.2 components
  * A framework for execution of arbitrary OpenMAX IL graphs (tunneled and
    non-tunneled) using a custom, [easy-to-write XML syntax](http://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/wiki/Mp3Playback101).
  * Skema repo: http://github.com/tizonia/skema

## How to build ##

To build and install from source, follow the following steps (Ubuntu 14.04 is assumed).

### Dependencies ###

```bash

    $ sudo apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install -qq \
    build-essential autoconf automake autotools-dev \
    libtool libmad0-dev liblog4c-dev \
    libasound2-dev libdbus-1-dev \
    libdbus-c++-dev libsqlite3-dev libboost-all-dev \
    uuid-dev libsdl1.2-dev libvpx-dev libavcodec-dev \
    libavformat-dev libavdevice-dev libmp3lame-dev libfaad-dev \
    libev-dev libtag1-dev libfishsound-dev libmediainfo-dev \
    libcurl3-dev libpulse-dev libmpg123-dev libvorbis-dev libopus-dev \
    libopusfile-dev libogg-dev libflac-dev liboggz2-dev \
    libsndfile1-dev curl check wget sqlite3 dbus-x11

```

### libspotify binaries ###

To stream music from Spotify, libspotify needs to be present in the
system. A suitable 'libspotify' flavour can be downloaded for your system from here:

    https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/

E.g.: (replace *$INSTALL_DIR* with your favorite location):

```bash

    $ wget https://developer.spotify.com/download/libspotify/libspotify-12.1.51-Linux-x86_64-release.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf libspotify-12.1.51-Linux-x86_64-release.tar.gz
    $ cd libspotify-12.1.51-Linux-x86_64-release
    $ make install prefix=$INSTALL_DIR

```

### Building libraries, plugins and RM framework ###

From the top of the repo (replace *$INSTALL_DIR* with your favorite location):

```bash

    $ autoreconf -ifs
    $ ./configure --enable-silent-rules --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -DNDEBUG"
    $ make
    $ make install

```

### Building 'tizonia', the music player and streaming client/server ###

From the 'tizonia' sub-folder (again replace *$INSTALL_DIR* with your favorite location):

```bash

    $ cd tizonia
    $ autoreconf -ifs
    $ ./configure --enable-silent-rules --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -DNDEBUG"
    $ make
    $ make install

```

### Tizonia config file and the D-BUS service activation file ###

Place *tizonia.conf* and the Resource Manager's D-BUS activation file to the
following locations:

```bash

    $ cp config/tizonia.conf ~/.tizonia.conf
    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services
    $ cp rm/dbus/com.aratelia.tiz.rm.service ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services

```

#### Known issues ####

`tizonia` makes heavy use the the the
[Boost Meta State Machine (MSM)](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html)
library by Christophe Henry (MSM is in turn based on
[Boost MPL](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/mpl/doc/index.html)).

MSM is used to generate a number of state machines that control the tunneled
OpenMAX IL components for the various playback uses cases. The state machines
are quite large and MSM is known for not being easy on the compilers. Building
`tizonia` requires a bit of patience and a whole lot of RAM (2.5+ GB).

You may see GCC crashing like below; simply keep running `make -j1` or `make
-j1 install` until the application is fully built (it will eventually, given
the sufficient amount RAM).
